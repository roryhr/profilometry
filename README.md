This is the code used in my UC Santa Barbara Master's Thesis
"Experimental apparatus for the study of Faraday waves on time-varying domains".Santa Barbara, CA. Dec, 2014. Basically, we shine a projector on diffusive surface and by cleverly processing the images, we can extract 3D data of the position of the surface (i.e. a height measurement for each pixel in an image). 

The code is in MATLAB and the Fourier Transform Profilometry technique is adopted from:
